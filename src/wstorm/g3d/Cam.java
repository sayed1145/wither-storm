/**
 * Real pinhole perspective camera shared by the in-game renderer and the offline baker.
 *
 * <p>The camera sits at (0, cy, D) above the building (south of its centre) and its image plane is parallel
 * to the ground ("shift lens"). This is a genuine 3D perspective projection, but the ground plane z=0 maps
 * 1:1 onto Mindustry's tile grid, so every model stays perfectly aligned with its footprint while heights
 * lean away from the camera with correct foreshortening. Along any pixel ray, a larger z is nearer to the
 * camera, which gives the baker an exact depth test and the live renderer an exact painter order.
